# Missile Run

A small 3D game built in Unity where you control a guided missile flying through an underground tunnel system. Your goal is to reach the target at the end of each level without colliding with the walls or obstacles.

## Overview
This project was created to learn the fundamentals of Unity game development, including scene management, physics, and collision detection.
All 3D models were designed in Blender, and the gameplay runs on C# using Unity's built in components.
